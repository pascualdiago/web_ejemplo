abstract = {This study explores “Gyneco-Obstetric Algebraic Didactics” (GOAD), a pioneering approach fusing mathematical didactics with obstetric learning. Using inventive models such as the Ovary-Function Theorem (OFT) and the Cervix-Dilation Equation , the cognitive and emotional outcomes of teaching mathematics using obstetric metaphors are rigorously evaluated. Sixty pregnant mathematicians and sixty gynecology students participated, revealing that metaphoric teaching not only improved calculus scores by 16.5 points but also reduced birth anxiety by 13.7%. The introduction of Fibonacci-based labor charts led to an unexpected increase in affinity for abstract algebra, suggesting possible interdisciplinary applications for both education and clinical practice.},
